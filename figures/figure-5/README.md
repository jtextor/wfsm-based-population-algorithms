# WFSM-based evolutionary algorithm

The data from which the plots in the paper are made, can be found in
the `data/` folder.  If you wish to reproduce, perform a `make clean`,
then remake with `make -j 4`, replacing `4` with however many processes
you want to run in parallel.  Be aware that reproducing the result from
scratch will take some time.
